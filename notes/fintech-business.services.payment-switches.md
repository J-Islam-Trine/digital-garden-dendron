* Payment switches are transaction-based software systems. 
* Using merchant-driven rules, switches dynamically route payment transactions between multiple acquirers and Payment Service Providers (PSPs) end-points.
* Rules include: 
	* retry of declined transactions, 
	* routing by lower cost, 
	* routing by time of day, 
	* routing by BIN, 
	* and routing by amount.  

This ability to dynamically route transactions makes **payment switches different from traditional [payment gateways](Payment%20Gateway)**.
