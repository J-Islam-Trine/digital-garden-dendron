### What is payment gateway?
* Gateways also connect merchants with multiple end-points.
* But their connections are normally pre-defined and not easily altered (i.e. “static”). 
* Moving transactions from one acquirer to another is generally a manual process that must be performed by the gateway operator. 
* This significant difference in routing connections dictates the use of different terminology from [payment switches](Payment%20Switch).
