* **3DS**
	* “3D” stands for “3 Domain”, which includes the issuer domain, acquirer domain, and interoperability domain.
	* 3D Secure 1 relies on the inputs from the three entities/domains that are involved in credit card transactions: the issuer of the card, the bank of the retailer/merchant and the credit card company utilizing the security protocol.
	* The inability of mobile browsers to accommodate the pop-up has proved to be an issue for the 3-D Secure Version 1.0.
	* EMV 3DS or 3DSv2.0 beefs up authentication by adopting biometric and token-based identity verification.
	* The 3-D Secure Version 2.0 bypasses the initial sign up process in order to create a user-friendly and frictionless credit card transaction authentication system.
